              We take customer feedback seriously â€” we use it to know what and
              where we can improve to make the process of booking a rental car
              even clearer and simpler. Every review matters to us. With these
              reviews, you won't have to take our word on its face, but you can
              be assured that what we say about ourselves is what customers
              think, too.
